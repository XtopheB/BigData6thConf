# R Ladies Sydney - Machine Learning workshop part 1

:star: Hello there! :star:

Here I keep all the files for the R-Ladies Sydney workshop, given on the 10th of October, 2018. Files I have uploaded include everything needed to generate the slide deck (`index.rmd`), as well as source code for the Shiny apps demonstrated in the talk.

Libraries you will need to compile these slides include

* `xaringan`
* `ggplot2`
* `randomForest`
* `rpart`
* `rpart.plot`
* `class`
* `MASS`
* `latex2exp`
* `dplyr`
* `multiDA` (which can be found [here](https://github.com/sarahromanes/multiDA))
* `anicon` (which can be found [here](https://github.com/emitanaka/anicon))

If you are interested, you might like to see files for *part two* of the ML workshop, which is about **assessing model performance**. These are located here.

Also, massive thanks to **Emi Tanaka** for developing the *Kunoichi* xaringan theme (Yihui Xie), of which the source can be found [**here**](https://github.com/emitanaka/ninja-theme).
