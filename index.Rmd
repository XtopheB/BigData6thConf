### **Big Data** here is a shortcut for **New Data Sources and Big Data**

###  "Teaching" with a ? 
* Difference between the two...
* Of course, even on a  "Training" course,  we do "teach" 
* At the SIAP, courses include both training and teaching
* *I'll come back to that later*

# NSOs!

???
* With covid-19, NSOs had to **adapt** 
* Many NSOs had to provide **decision-making** data for gvts, responsible for **data dissemination** --> data literacy
* Some had to construct new **data-driven pipelines** for politicians, the public and **journalists** 
* **Collecting** Big Data is important to **complement** official or adminstrative data (integration ia difficult), but this collection is **necessary** and **critical** when it comes to emmergency decisions  (such as during Covid-19 or during disasters)

--

# NSOs have .orange[new needs]
--

# NSOs have now new missions

--

# NSOs have new constraints and timelines

--

# NSOs **may** have the resources to access and use Big Data

--
# NSOs see in Big Data great opportunities but face .orange[**challenges!**]

???
Many course at SIAP for quite some time now

- Include the **Data scientist** toolbox on different typ of Data (GIS, Scanner, text,... )
- Big Data course with Statistics Korea (regional training)
- We had a more general course on **ICT Innovations for Modernizing Official Statistical Systems**with people from the **WorldBank**
- includes Big Data (with Python); GIS (Qgis);  webscrapping 

**NOW** We will adapt these materials for online courses thanks to our **new LMS**

# .center[So, what should we .orange[focus] on?]
### .center[(*A personal view*)]


???
* **Rq1:**: **Soft skills** are an important component (see Covid-19) 
  * how to negotiate a contract with a data provider?
  * How to disseminate/communicate? Etc 
  but I will manly focus on Statistics
  
**Rq2:**: Member of the UN Task Team on Skills, Training and Capacity Development, I will not talk on behalf of this group  see later by **Ceri**

## .orange[New methods]

???
* First , adapt **everything** to online teaching! (I will return to that in a minute!)
  * **SIAP has been doing e-learning since 2013**


* Obviously **New methods**  and here I talk of **Teaching** --> knowledge

> We cannot afford to let people use software, black boxes, or programs without a > **good understanding of the statistical foundations!!**

#### Methods
* Integration is tricky, biaises, trust --> quality data
* Statistical learning to avoid "black box" statistics: **Big Data literacy**
* Many New source have **spatial component**, not easy to disaggrate or aggregate spatialy 
* Decision-based statistics are visual (Covid-19), how do people/politicians understand that?

# .center[.orange[Variety] is key!]

???
There is a discussion/ reflection on how to improve our e-courses (**New LMS**)

**no one-size-fits-all** solution!

* *Micro learning* : Example: Sometimes, we don't need to follow a 4 week course to apply web-scrapping or  text analysis or draw a map..
* Can be nice assets and a **self-paced** way of learning

* *Social learning* We have tons of very good examples from NSOs themselves
  - We already introduced Webinars
  - Involve the learners with case studies
  - Make learners work in groups (**YES**, this is possible online)
  - Have online discussions (not at the end of the course)
  
* Engagement: Split course in phases 1- we train, 2- Learners apply 3- They show/explain  4 (optional) - we evaluate! 
* Games (already did that with Kahoot)
* Contest: There is an ongoing Hackathon on Marine Traffic (AIS Data)

# .center[Final .orange[Thoughts]]

<br>
 
## .orange[Big Data] training:

--
### - Involve .orange[many different] subjects, diciplines, type of data, (national/ regional) contexts

--

### - Resemble to .orange[*data science*] training
--

### -  Needs .orange[coordination] and .orange[cooperation] between course providers (including Academics)

--

### -  Should .orange[use NSOs examples] (Covid-19) as cases studies / practical trainings

--

### -  Needs .orange[online courses] as well as face-to-face
